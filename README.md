# AddressBook
Description :-
    In this project, each person's contact information including name, phone number, and email address will 
be saved in an organized structural array.

    To select the sort of activity we need to perform, we will declare distinct methods in this example for 
creating,listing, searching, editing, and deleting contacts. These functions will be called inside a switch case. 

REQUIREMENTS :
                1. FILE POINTERS
                2. ARRAYS
                3. STRUCTURES
                4. STRINGS
                5 PREDEFINED functions
                

# Load contact from file: -
    In this function we are calling the file pointer to get data from the txt file, in which contact is saved already.
In the txt file we are giving a delim as comma(,),to segregate name, phone number and email to save in structure array.

For example the file containing the contact details as 
Isabella White 			,5552461357  			  ,isabella.white@example.com	

to separate the name we use strtok function and store in in the name array.

# Create Contact :-
      In creating contact first thing is to check if the conatact is present or not.if the contact is present 
it have to print "ERROR : NAME OR PHONE OR EMAIL ID ALREADY EXISTS".

if the name is present or not ,if same name found it will print "Name already exists".

Input   : John Doe
